# Project description
        
In this project I refactored the index.html file with semantic HTML markup to better structure the code.  I also made changes to the style.css file so that the website would still deploy after changes had been made to the original HTML elements.  I replaced <div> elements in the HTML code to to improve the semantic markup of the file with the following elements: <header>, <nav>, figure, main, article, section, aside, alt, & footer.  I then made changes to the CSS so that the HTML file was still able to correctly call on the different styling directions for the page.
