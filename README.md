# Project description
        
        In this porject I refactored the index.html file with semantic HTML markup to better structur the code.  I also made changes to the style.css file so that the website would still deploy after changes had been made the the original HTML elements.  I replaced <div> elements in the HTML code to to improve the semantic markup of the file: <header>, <nav>, <figure>, <main>, <artical>, <section>, <aside>, alt="", & <footer>.  I then made changes to the CSS so that the HTML file was still able to correctly call on the diffent styling directions for the page.
